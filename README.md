Security Risk Dashboard

`*alpha software*`

This is a simple dashboard that shows the security risk of open-source projects. Target audiences include:
- Software Developers -> quickly evaluate the risk of OSS they already use or plan to use in their product
- Security Engineering Teams -> incorporate the rich set of metrics into their risk assessment process
- Engineering Management -> understand ecosystem-wide risk and make informed decisions about OSS usage

The dashboard is customizable and incorporates data from the following sources (more to come):
- OpenSSF Scorecard
- Libraries.io
- git
- GitHub
